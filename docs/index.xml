      <description>We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene. There is no silver bullet.  Adding a Construction Exercise tax does not need to be part of the solution. Lowering city permit fees and System Development Charges should be part of our solution. In some places in the city we need to increase population density. We need to protect the look, feel, and vibe of our city. Providing pathways to more efficient using the structures already in use in our city should be a policy making priority.</description>

      <description>How will you help lead your city/count/local jurisdiction toward 100% Clean Energy by 2050? We need to work on community development strategies (especially at the city policy level) that make passive home construction practical and affordable. We need create an economy where renewable energy solutions are the affordable solution.
What are your top two environmental priorities?  Securing the solar access rights of all property owners. Bringing edible plants to Eugene public spaces.</description>
