      <description>The measure for independent Auditor sets the tone for this election. The People of Eugene expect Clarity, Openness, and a demonstration of responsibility from their elected officials and their appointed officials.
The essence of Eugene that we hold dear, be it our Eugene neighborhoods or the larger character of our city is being challenged by internal and external pressures.
The pace and scope of change in Eugene is set to increase.</description>

      <description>We can increase Accountability through an independent elected auditor Read the ballot measure 20-283. It is professional. This is the professional solution. Eugene is mature enough to benefit from an elected auditor.
We can increase Accountability by making Eugene&amp;rsquo;s transactional data open By putting Eugene&amp;rsquo;s transactional data in the open it gives citizens the capability of engage in areas of interest to them and have the same data that the city is looking at.</description>

      <description>No paper or plastic campaign signs Recently Hugh went to the The Glenwood Central Receiving Station. He says:
 I noticed all these political signs in the trash. It really challenged me to think about the environmental impacts of my campaign. I can run a facebook add just as much as printing signs and flyers. It has less of an impact to the environment.
 If you want a city councilor who is concerned with the environment and our social responsibility, look no further than Hugh Paterson III.</description>

      <description>We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene. There is no one size fits all solution. There is no silver bullet. We have various kinds of housing crisis in Eugene. We have chronically homeless. We have temporary homeless. We have a shortage of affordable housing for people on fixed incomes who want to own their own property. We have a shortage of housing for (lower income) students. We have a shortage of small properties for single member households.</description>

      <description>Open Data in context In the Eugene context of governance, citizens want to know that the city is acting fairly and in their best interests. One way to do this is to take the city&amp;rsquo;s transactional and research data and put that in the public space.
For Eugene there are two important aspects of open data: comprehension and possess-ability.
Comprehension The web is a primary means of communication for many (most) of the people living in Eugene.</description>

      <title>Capitol Hill PUD</title>

      <description>Where does Hugh stand on the Capitol Hill PUD? City council involvement As it stands right now the city council does not have an avenue, or reason to be involved in the PUD process - on the Capitol Hill PUD or any other PUD. PUD approval is an administrative process. A very relevant question could be: Has the city administration done due diligence to preserve city scene scape?
Working to create policy and better direct city staff on how to preserve city scene scape is something that city council can do.</description>

      <title>Construction Exercise Tax</title>

      <description>Should Eugene implement a Construction Exercise Tax (CET )? In response to Jacob Fox and Terry McDonald who published a guest opinion in the Register Guard on April 6th 2018. It does not make sense to implement a CET in Eugene.
When we look at how the math pencils out, it would be much better for Eugene Citizens to donate to 501( c)3 organizations like St. Vincent de Paul who are making a real difference in Lane County.</description>

      <description>Where does Hugh stand on Preservation of the Hayward Field East Grandstands? City council involvement This is not directly a policy issue. However, there are several interesting issues around the replacement and/or preservation of the Hayward Field East Grandstands.
The grand stands are an iconic feature of Eugene The grandstands to take us to a place where history was made. Both for the then future of Nike, and the University of Oregon.</description>

      <title>Parks Bond</title>

      <description>Parks Benefits No doubt that we need our parks. Hugh personally benefits from the recently redone Amazon playgraound.
Hugh says: &amp;gt; I really value the work that our parks staff have put into projects like Amazon playground. My daughter enjoys it too.
Parks Management It is concerning to Hugh that we need a bond measure at all. Obviously as a city we have over extended our financial limitations. When we are running our own personal finances if we want a pleasure fishing boat we can either save up for it, or take out a loan.</description>
