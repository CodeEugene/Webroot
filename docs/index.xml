      <description>We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene. There is no one size fits all solution. There is no silver bullet. We have various kinds of housing crisis in Eugene. We have chronically homeless. We have temporary homeless. We have a shortage of affordable housing for people on fixed incomes who want to own their own property. We have a shortage of housing for (lower income) students. We have a shortage of small properties for single member households.</description>

We need create an economy where renewable energy solutions are the affordable solution.
What are your top two environmental priorities?  Securing the solar access rights of all property owners. Bringing edible plants to Eugene public spaces.</description>

      <description>Open Data in context In the Eugene context of Governance Citizens want to know that the city is acting fairly and in their best interests. One way to do this is to take the city&amp;rsquo;s transactional and research data and put that in the public space.
For Eugene there are two important aspects of open data: comprehension and possess-ability.
Comprehension The web is a primary means of communication for many (most) of the people living in Eugene.</description>

      <description>The measure for independent Auditor sets the tone for this election. The People of Eugene expect Clarity, Openness, and a demonstration of responsibility from their elected officials and their appointed officials.

The pace and scope of change in Eugene is set to increase.</description>
