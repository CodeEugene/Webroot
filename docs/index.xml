      <description>We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene. There is no silver bullet.  Adding a Construction Exercise tax does not need to be part of the solution. Lowering city permit fees and System Development Charges should be part of our solution. In some places in the city we need to increase population density. We need to protect the look, feel, and vibe of our city. Providing pathways to more efficient using the structures already in use in our city should be a policy making priority.</description>

      <description>Friends,
The measure for independent Auditor sets the tone for this election. The People of Eugene expect Clarity, Openness, and a demonstration of responsibility from their elected officials and their appointed officials.
The essence of Eugene that we hold dear, be it our Eugene neighborhoods or the larger character of our city is being challenged by internal and external pressures.
The pace and scope of change in Eugene is set to increase.</description>

      <description>How will you help lead your city/count/local jurisdiction toward 100% Clean Energy by 2050? We need to work on community development strategies (especially at the city policy level) that make passive home construction practical and affordable. We need create an economy where renewable energy solutions are the affordable solution.
What are your top two environmental priorities?  Securing the solar access rights of all property owners. Bringing edible plants to Eugene public spaces.</description>

      <description>Open Data in context In the Eugene context of Governance Citizens want to know that the city is acting fairly and in their best interests. One way to do this is to take the city&amp;rsquo;s transactional and research data and put that in the public space.
For Eugene there are two important aspects of open data: comprehension and possess-ability.
Comprehension The web is a primary means of communication for many (most) of the people living in Eugene.</description>
