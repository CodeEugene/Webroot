      <description>The Eugene City Chamber of Commerce invited all three Ward 3 candidates to answer four questions and some questions from its members. (My answers can be found on my Q &amp;amp; A page.)
 What do you see as your role as an elected official? How do you or would you make decisions on council? Increasing affordability, availability and diversity of housing is a high priority of the Chamber. What do you see as the biggest challenges to addressing this and can you provide a few ideas on actions that you, as a City Councilor, can take to improve housing in Eugene?</description>
